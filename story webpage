    <p>An ant works tirelessly to gather food and store
         it in its nest, while a grasshopper spends the
          warm days singing and dancing. The grasshopper
           makes fun of the ant for working so hard.</p>
           <p>The weather turns cold, and snow covers the
             ground, leaving no food for the grasshopper.
              Shivering and starving, the grasshopper goes
               to the ant's home to beg for food.</p>
